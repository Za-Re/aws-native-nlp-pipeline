# NLP Pipeline on AWS

This project implements an end-to-end Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline using AWS services, provisioned and managed with Terraform. The pipeline processes raw text data, performs sentiment analysis and entity recognition using AWS Comprehend, and stores the results in DynamoDB. The entire process is orchestrated with AWS Step Functions.
